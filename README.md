This is an introduction code to Rust, which will work with sets and vectors.

SCHEDULE
---------

- 2/3/22
  * start plans for `seti.rs`

- 2/15/22
  * continue work on `crate::enci`

- 2/26/22
  * did work on `crate::enci` and add `ds_fob_c.rs` to `crate::setti`
  * proceed to `SetImp`

- 2/27/22
  * Here are the project plans ahead.
    * Impliar will be the flame that dies. Or the last    
      flame that goes out, per se. Some will blame the
      ice.

- 3/12/22
  * I have not been able to do much.

- 4/11/22
  * Attend(ed|ing) to real-life issues. I almost forgot about this thing.

- 5/9/22
  * Worked on adding some important structs. Forecast is that project is
    behind schedule, but still on track.

- 5/25/22
  * Code analysis is required for redundant code. The issue is looking more
    probable as this project's cache computation requirements follow the
    same basic pattern.

  * update (evening):
      Code analysis and refactoring will hold off until integration code
      between `metrice::brp` and `metrice::gorillasf` has been built.

- 6/8/22
  * planning for another file called `skewcorrctr.rs` in `metrice`.
